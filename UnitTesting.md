QUnit is a Javascript unit testing framework that works in HTML and looks really easy to use. I'll put it and the unit test file on Google Code tomorrow (March 27). We should only need one file to store and execute all of our unit tests, which will make regression testing easier.

From now on, write unit tests in QUnit and upload them to Google Code before writing any function. Otherwise, it'll be easy to forget to write these tests.

The QUnit homepage is at https://qunitjs.com/.
