#summary This page describes how to make SVG images.

= Introduction =

SVG is an open-source standard for images that is widely supported across the web (including by the vector graphics library [http://code.google.com/p/canvg canvg]). This page describes two ways to create and edit SVG images.


= Inkscape =

The open-source image editor [http://www.inkscape.org/ Inkscape] is definitely the easier of the two methods. It works a lot like Paint, but is different enough that you'll have to play with it to get used to it. The file needs to have a size in pixels (and is by default the size of a piece of paper), but the size doesn't really matter because vector graphics scale without loss of quality.


= XML =

The SVG standard actually stores each image as XML, so in theory they can be created and edited with any text editor. In practice, creation this way would be tedious, but to change one or a few properties of an image, it may be easier than Inkscape. It is certainly more precise. The XML format is self-explanatory, so you could easily, for instance, change the color and text of the Start button to make other buttons without opening an image editor.
